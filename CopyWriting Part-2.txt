Fun Fact: The world emits around 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases each year [measured in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq)]. To prevent severe climate change we need to rapidly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

*** A Study Of India on Carbon Emissions ***
--Bar Graph for Indian Cities & their emissions.
The national capital - Delhi has the highest annual carbon footprint in the country. In fact, Delhi’s annual CO2 emission of 69.4 million tonnes is equal to the CO2 emission of Bangalore,
Hyderabad and Chennai put together. When it comes to per capita CO2 emission, Chandigarh and Vadodara are far ahead of the rest with 3.9 tonnes and 3.5 tonnes respectively. The carbon footprint for a Mumbaiite was concentrated in the range of 0.51 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Our analysis found that higher income groups have a higher carbon consumption
lifestyle as compared to those from lower income groups. CO2 emissions are dominated by the burning of fossil fuels for energy production and industrial production of materials such as cement. Since India has the second highest population in the world i.e 17.5% of the worlds total population, this increases the consumption of food, energy, goods and services thereby resulting in the further increase of CO2 emission. 

--“The wealthy need to understand climate change because they are the ones who own two to three cars and use air-conditioners; all of which are high carbon dioxide emitters. Cutting down on electricity bills and car fuel will also mean monetary gain for the individual.”--<blockquote>

Our research says that China emitted 27% of the world's greenhouse gases. The US is the second-largest emitter at 15.6% while India is at third with 6.3% of emissions. Since population of U.S is very much less than that of India it is thus observed that U.S emit more carbon than India due to their higher living standards.
